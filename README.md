# Simple Python Calculator

A beginner-friendly Python project to practice programming fundamentals.  
This calculator is continuously updated as I learn and add more features.  
Since this is a personal learning project, contributions are welcome, but the main purpose is to showcase my progress in Python.

**Current Version:** `1.2.0`  

---

## Features
- Get numbers from the user (input validated; only numbers allowed)
- Choose the operation after entering the first number (simulates natural calculator workflow)
- Perform **basic arithmetic operations**:
  - Addition (+)
  - Subtraction (-)
  - Multiplication (*)
  - Division (/) with zero-check
- Perform **extended arithmetic operations**:
  - Modulus (%) with zero-check
  - Floor division (//) with zero-check
  - Exponentiation (^)
- Clear and informative error messages for invalid inputs or operations
- Allow multiple calculations in a row without restarting

---

## Planned Features
- Store and reuse the last result (memory function)
- Support more than two numbers for operations
- Add advanced mathematical functions: square root, trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan), logarithm
- Implement a user-friendly graphical interface (GUI)
- Save calculation history to a file for later reference

---

## Installation
Make sure you have **Python 3** installed.  

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/morinalulzim/calculator.git
cd calculator
```

## Learning Goals for this Project
This project helps me practice:
- Writing Python scripts
- Handling user input safely
- Implementing basic and extended arithmetic operations
- Error handling in Python
- Using Git & GitHub for version control

---

## Usage
Run the calculator with:
```bash
python3 calculator.py
```

---

## Example
```
Enter first number: 4
Choose operation (+, -, *, /, %, //, ^): *
Enter second number: 6
Result: 24
```
