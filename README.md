# Simple Python Calculator

A beginner-friendly Python project to practice programming fundamentals.  
This calculator is continuously updated as I learn and add more features.  
Since this is a personal learning project, contributions are welcome, but the main purpose is to showcase my progress in Python.

**Current Version:** `1.1.0`  

---

## Features
- Get numbers from the user (previously only two, now flexible for any two numbers)  
- Perform addition (`+`) and display the result  
- Perform subtraction (`-`)  
- Perform multiplication (`*`)  
- Perform division (`/`) with zero-check  
- Perform modulus (`%`) with zero-check  
- Perform floor division (`//`) with zero-check  
- Perform exponentiation (`^`)  
- Clear error messages for invalid operations  

---

## Planned Features
- User-friendly menu (still in progress)  
- Advanced error handling (e.g., type checking, invalid input handling improvements)  

---

## Installation
Make sure you have **Python 3** installed.  

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/morinalulzim/calculator.git
cd calculator
```

## Learning Goals for this Project
This project helps me practice:
- Writing Python scripts
- Handling user input
- Implementing basic arithmetic operations
- Error handling in Python
- Using Git & GitHub for version control

---

## Usage
Run the calculator with:
```bash
python3 calculator.py
```

---

## Example
```
Enter first number: 4
Enter second number: 6
Choose operation (+, -, *, /, %, //, ^): *
Result: 24
```
